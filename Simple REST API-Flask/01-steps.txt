1. install Flask & flask-restful (flask-restful allows us to write class based Views as in Django)
2. Create an object of Flask and pass __name__ to it
3. Create an object of flask_restful class then pass the flask object created above eg. app
4. Then Create a class and inside it write your get() or post() methods
5. define the route of that class
6. Create get, post, put, delete functions under your respective classes # always play on a hard coded dictionary first
7. Setup POSTMAN ---> create a workspace ---> create a Collection ---> Keep on adding the requests & save them

8. pip install flask-sqlalchemy # it is a kind of ORM that allows us to connect with our db without using sql cmds
   It's basically a middle man between flask and db

-------------------------DB CONFIGURATION-------------------------
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///todo.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

9. Now since the db is configured you need to create a Model so that you don't have to migrate that db.
10. After creating the class go to your terminal ---->
    python >>> from app import db
                db.create_all()
                exit()

11. After adding the db config class and all. make sure to serialize your objects before returning (@marshal_with)
